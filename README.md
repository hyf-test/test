# Agile software development

Agile is a type of software development methodology that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism to the delivery of the finished product. Agile software development requires a cultural shift in many companies because it focuses on the clean delivery of individual pieces or parts of the software and not on the entire application.

Benefits of Agile include its ability to help teams in an evolving landscape while maintaining a focus on the efficient delivery of business value.&#x20;

The collaborative culture facilitated by Agile also improves efficiency throughout the organization as teams work together and understand their specific roles in the process.&#x20;

Finally, companies using Agile software development can feel confident that they are releasing a high-quality product because testing is performed throughout development. This provides the opportunity to make changes as needed and alert teams to any potential issues.

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

_We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it._

_Through this work we have come to value:_

_**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools_

_**Working software** over comprehensive documentation_

_**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation_

_**Responding to change** over following a plan_

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._
