Extreme Programming is often called the most innovative software development methodology. That can be explained by the fact that it was invented to deliver high-quality products within the shortest amount of time.

XP is considered an Agile method because it shares the main Agile principles, including strong communication, a high degree of customer involvement, and an iterative structure of projects.

It is necessary to mention that Extreme Programming has the highest degree of customer involvement among other Agile methodologies. The client is a part of the XP team. This methodology also has the shortest iterations. A typical iterative cycle in Extreme Programming lasts only one week.

It focuses on the whole-team approach. In this case, the emphasis is on practices that eliminate distracting clutter.

The fundamental values of XP are _simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect_. Members of the XP team are, ideally, not specialists, but can fulfill many roles—analyst, coach or facilitator, manager, etc. At the core of the XP team, however, is always a business representative called _“the customer.”_&#x20;
