# Agile software development

Agile is a type of software development methodology that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism to the delivery of the finished product.

Benefits of Agile include its ability to help teams in an evolving landscape while maintaining a focus on the efficient delivery of business value.

The collaborative culture facilitated by Agile also improves efficiency throughout the organization as teams work together and understand their specific roles in the process.

Finally, companies using Agile software development can feel confident that they are releasing a high-quality product because testing is performed throughout development. This provides the opportunity to make changes as needed and alert teams to any potential issues.

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

_We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it._

_Through this work we have come to value:_

_**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools_ - Businesspeople and developers must work together daily through out the project.

_**Working software** over comprehensive documentation_ - simlicity the art of maximizing the amount of work done is essential

_**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation_ - welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitve advantage.

_**Responding to change** over following a plan_ - build projects arround motivated individuals. Give them the enviroment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._

## Agile lifecycle

The Agile software development life cycle is the structured series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to end. It contains six phases: **concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance, and retirement.**

## Agile frameworks

An agile framework incorporates elements of continuous planning, testing, integration, and other forms of continuous development. Agile frameworks are lightweight compared to traditional development methods, which means that rules and practices are kept to a minimum.

#### Purpose

The purpose of the game is for everybody to participate and share their opinions, thoughts, feelings, ideas and practical use of the agile manifesto and its principles. They will be doing this by playing a matching game.

#### Objectives

* Cultivate the agile thinking from the early stages of the transformation.
* Foster an agile mindset.
* Understand the meaning of the agile manifesto.
* Look closer for deeper, hidden or unexplored aspects and applications to their daily work. Team building.

#### What you need

* from 1 to 5 teams/pairs (up to 20 to 30 people)
* agile manifesto and principles cards for each team/pair (download the material in English below)
* a timer/alarm clock/app
* post its (or several color papers) crayons, color pencils/markers
* blank poster (or flip chart blank page) per team

#### How to run the workshop

1. Preparation (1-5 minutes) Explain: the rules and purpose of the game. Set up the teams: according to the physical space organize the teams (or pairs) for discussion. Read the manifesto: or even better, ask somebody to help you read the manifesto out loud for all of them. Deliver the principle cards for each team/pair: ask them to check they have the complete set (the manifesto and 12 principles) before starting.
2. Discussion and matching (20-25 minutes) Instruction: The participants must match each principle to one of the manifesto’s item. Set the timer for discussion: Each team/pair must be accountable for the time remaining. Let the conversation begin!
3. Sharing thoughts (15-20 minutes.) Share results: especially the ones contrasting between teams. Ask what were the conclusions pointed out from the discussions.

Sum up: get the teams to deliberate about their outcomes. Ask them for examples.

Powerful questions:

* Do we understand each one of the principles?
* How can we apply them on a daily basis?
* Does it really matter to associate every principle to a single rule from the manifesto?
* How our daily work would look and feel like if we did all this?
* What are the obstacles we have to overcome to get there?
* What can we do as a team and individually to contribute to this ideal goal?

1. Making the poster: collaboration (15-20 minutes)

_Let the creativity spirit take over_: any material they want to use is valid. Foster collaboration and ask them to cooperate altogether in the creation of the poster. All of them must take part. I encourage them to sign it, write their names on it, draw or put the team rubric on it afterwards.

_Make it visible_: finally we post it into a near wall or door where everybody can see it.

Additional tips:

```
- It is better to have teams/pairs with people who don’t know each other so they can interact more and get to know each other better.

-The principles have been numbered in case the cards get jumbled up, but these numbers doesn’t mean anything else.

- When matching, you will notice that sometimes teams want to get “the right answer” or “the right number of matching” (for instance, 3 principles per manifesto item). Don’t interviene, let them figure it out. The goal of the game is to let them talk about it, not to be right or wrong. They will soon be engaged and establish their own method for matching. Just let them work.

- If you see the game is turning into a desperate matching without conversation for any team ask them for examples or powerful questions to stoke the chat.
