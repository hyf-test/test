Kanban is based on four principles: visualization of workflow, limitation of work in progress, focus on flow, and continuous improvement.

When working on a project, the questions that should always be asked are, _"Where do we want to go, and what do we want to achieve?"_  Kanban streamlines the workflow by focusing on the _“flow of value,”_

A core property of Kanban is visualizing not only workflow but also incoming work requests, thus optimizing the workflow system in a significant way.&#x20;

Kanban recognizes that the key to success is limiting work in progress (WIP); new work is only drawn into the workflow when there is available capacity.

One of the great benefits of Kanban is that it can be imposed on existing processes.
