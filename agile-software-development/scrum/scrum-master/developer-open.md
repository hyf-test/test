# Developer open

test-first development: Designing tests before satisfying them.

unit-test: the test executes fast. code in each test is as small as possible while maintaining readability of the code. each test is dependent of other unit tests. each test makes assertions about only one logical concept.

devleoper must be present at the daily scrum.

product backlog items are refined by the scrum team

system's architecture is decided through out the project, as understanding emerges and the Developers learn more about the product.&#x20;

the benefits of establishing naming standards for code is to make the code more readable.

unit test is a test the isolates and verifies individual units of source code.&#x20;

shortcomings of code coverage: it does not ensure that the most important or highest risk areas of the code are being exercised by tests. could create incentives to write tests that simply in crease code coverage, rater than tests that find bugs without increasing coverage . it doesn't provide functional coverage.&#x20;

it shows code being exercised by tests&#x20;

not metrics of code quality: cycle time per feature and code coverage

## PSM I

* The Development Team is responsible for all estimates in the Product Backlog. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.
* Scrum does not require having aligned Sprints for multiple teams.
* The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage. The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.
* Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. There is no need to decompose all the Items in the Sprint Backlog. It can be done only for the first days of the Sprint.
* The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
*   Sprint Planning answers the following:

    * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
    * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

    The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.
* The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of “Done.”
* Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team
* The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.
* If the definition of “done” for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If “done” for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of “done” appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the development teams on all of the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of “Done.”
