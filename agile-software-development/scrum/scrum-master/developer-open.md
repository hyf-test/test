# Developer open

test-first development: Designing tests before satisfying them.

unit-test: the test executes fast. code in each test is as small as possible while maintaining readability of the code. each test is dependent of other unit tests. each test makes assertions about only one logical concept.

devleoper must be present at the daily scrum.

product backlog items are refined by the scrum team

system's architecture is decided through out the project, as understanding emerges and the Developers learn more about the product.&#x20;

the benefits of establishing naming standards for code is to make the code more readable.

unit test is a test the isolates and verifies individual units of source code.&#x20;

shortcomings of code coverage: it does not ensure that the most important or highest risk areas of the code are being exercised by tests. could create incentives to write tests that simply in crease code coverage, rater than tests that find bugs without increasing coverage . it doesn't provide functional coverage.&#x20;

it shows code being exercised by tests&#x20;

not metrics of code quality: cycle time per feature and code coverage
