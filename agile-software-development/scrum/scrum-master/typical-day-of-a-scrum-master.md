# Typical day of a Scrum Master

A typical day of a Scrum Master might involve a variety of activities, but the main focus is to ensure that the team is productive and that their work is progressing as planned. This could involve facilitating the team's daily standup, where team members discuss what they did the day before, what they plan to do that day, and if they are facing any obstacles. The Scrum Master might also help the team plan their sprints, by breaking down tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring that resources are available. Additionally, the Scrum Master might work with the Product Owner to clarify requirements and help the team prioritize their work. Finally, the Scrum Master might work with the team to identify areas of improvement and ensure that the team is following the Scrum framework.

hour to hour narration on what you are doing during a typical day of a Scrum Master.

9:00 — Log on, check emails, \*drink coffee\*, check my project board for items that need to be completed today, items that I’m still waiting for a reply on that I follow up on, and any items from my ‘backlog’ that I could pick up if I have the capacity that day (could include professional development projects or non-urgent items relating to the team). Today is a Sprint Review Day so I probably won’t have time to pick up anything additional as it is a packed day. If any team members have been away or off sick I may message to check in with them.

10:00 — Daily Scrum to walk the board with the team. We use JIRA and have a board for each of the iOS and Android Developers and a ‘Danban’ board for the Designers. After walking the board, we’ll discuss ‘offline’ items that arose from walking the board that needs further discussion (in a timeboxed manner). We also use the standup for any quick announcements like absences and reminders

11:00 — Demo Prep meeting with the Devs and QA’s. We do a final walkthrough of who is demo-ing in the Sprint Review and that we have all the test accounts and access to the appropriate testing environments. I’ll have prepared some slides for the Sprint Review to introduce our Sprint Goal and what the team worked on that sprint including stories/ features, tech tasks, and bugs. The team will decide and discuss if they want to share any of the tech tasks or bugs to highlight the business value of picking up tickets like this with our stakeholders.

12:00 — Sprint Review! We all gather as a team with any additional stakeholders or guests that we may have had dependencies with for that Sprint. The team demo what was done that sprint and discusses any tech tasks or bugs that are interesting to share. After the demo, we have a look at our Release Goals to see how the current Sprint is situated and how the next Sprint will be shaped in line with the Release Goals.

13:00 — Lunch! I’m a soup and salad lady these days. I usually also go for a walk around the neighborhood to freshen up my mind as I’m consciously reducing my caffeine intake so anything that healthily stimulates my energy levels is always welcome.

14:30 — Sprint Retrospective! One of my (and many of the team’s) favorite events of the week. We start with a silly icebreaker like a Kahoot! Quiz, a few rounds of Pictionary or a Mood Check (particularly since we have been remote working and in and out of lockdowns). A new change we’ve made is to populate our retrospective board (typically a Miro whiteboard) asynchronously in advance of the event. This allows people a bit more breathing space to think of items and has resulted in much stronger engagement. It also leaves us a little more time to discuss the topics at hand. We have tried a myriad of themes and formats to stimulate different kinds of engagement depending on how the team is doing and what kinds of impediments we are facing but the template usually follows a ‘What Went Well’, ‘What Could Have Been Better’, and ‘How to Move Forward’ baseline format. We also share ‘Kudos’ which have been a nice small morale booster amidst a challenging remote working environment.

15:30 — Quick comfort break for another short walk or to get some admin done

16:00 — Sprint Pre- Planning! Led by our Business Analysts, the team has an initial discussion about what backlog items they will work on for the upcoming sprint. The team will finalize this in a Sprint Planning meeting tomorrow morning.

17:00 — The Final Hour is spent regrouping from the day. I will spend this time consolidating the board from the Retrospective, checking in with team members if any impediments came up during the day, and if there is time, reading a few Medium articles or reading some of the posts in the [Serious Scrum Slack](https://www.seriousscrum.com/invite) group.
