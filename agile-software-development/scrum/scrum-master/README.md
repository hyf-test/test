# Scrum Master

The primary accountability of the Scrum Master is to provide delivery leadership, experience, and expertise by managing the scrum process and improving their organization's ability to deliver a valuable, relevant product.

**The Scrum Master is:**

* &#x20;a coach with individuals (no Subject Matter Expertise (SME) required),&#x20;
* a facilitator with groups (no SME required),
* a mentor with individuals (SME required), and&#x20;
* a teacher with groups (SME required).

## Promoting and Supporting Scrum

They are supposed to promote Scrum. This means they are responsible for strengthening the understanding of the ideas behind the framework, as well as spreading the ideas of Scrum beyond the scope of their own Scrum Team

* coaching team members, the organization, and stakeholders

They are supposed to support Scrum. This means they are responsible for maintaining Scrum within their teams and organizations by fulﬁlling such tasks as facilitating events and removing impediments.

**Responsibility**

The responsibility of the Scrum Master is, to conduct their activities in accordance with the Scrum Guide as well as promote and support the ideas in the Scrum Guide as the ”true Scrum.”

**Helping Others Understand Scrum**

Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

* _Practices_, such as the events and artefacts of Scrum
* _Rules_, which bind the framework together and deﬁne the relationship between events, artefacts and accountabilities
* _Values_, which together with empiricism, set the foundation for Scrum by providing guiding principles for those things for which the Scrum framework does not prescribe speciﬁc methods or tools

A Scrum Master does not need to be equipped with hierarchical authority to force Scrum onto teams and organizations.

Instead, spreading and supporting Scrum can be done by helping others understand Scrum theory - namely, the empirical process control of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Many organizations, when they choose their first Scrum Masters ,they look for management or leadership experience. As they become more experienced with Scrum, organizations eventually realize there are many more factors to consider in selecting Scrum Masters. (Responsible, humility, Collaboration, Commitment, Influence, Knowledgeability, Proactivity)

* A good Scrum Master is able and willing to assume **responsibility**. the Scrum Master is responsible for maximizing the throughput of the team and for assisting team members in adopting and using Scrum.
* the Scrum Master takes on this responsibility without assuming any of the authority that might be useful in achieving it.
* a good Scrum Master thrives on responsibility—**that special type of responsibility that comes without power.**
* A **humble** Scrum Master is one who realizes the job does not come with a company car or parking spot near the building entrance.
* Rather than putting her own needs first, a humble Scrum Master is willing to do **whatever is necessary to help the team achieve its goal.**
* A good Scrum Master works to ensure a **collaborative** culture exists within the team. The Scrum Master needs to make sure team members feel able to raise issues for open discussion and that they feel supported in doing so.
* a good Scrum Master **establishes collaboration as the team norm and will call out inappropriate behavior.**
* The Scrum Master must feel the same high level of **commitment** to the project and the goals of the current sprint as the team members do
* As part of that commitment, **a good Scrum Master does not end very many days with impediments left unaddressed**
* A successful Scrum Master influences others, both on and outside the team.
* Although Scrum Masters do not necessarily need to be marketing gurus or programming experts, **they should know enough about both to be effective in leading the team.**
*   the Scrum Master is a master at **encouraging, enabling, and energizing people and helping them to realize their potential.**



    As a true leader, the Scrum Master’s duties include the following:
* &#x20;Leading the team through healthy conflict and debate on ideas
* Teaching, mentoring, and coaching the organization and team in adopting and using Scrum
* Helping the team remove and prevent impediments
* Empowering and guiding the developers on self-management.

The authority of a Scrum Master is not exactly the same as that of a functional manager or a project manager, as he or she does not have the right to hire and fire and cannot ask the team about the completion of the task.

he Scrum Master also does not hold the responsibility of making sure the work gets done. **Instead, he or she helps the team define and adhere to its own process for making sure the work gets done.**

* #### Coach - Mentor - Facilitate - Teach

## Responsibilities during scrum events

**Sprint Planning Meetings:** The Scrum Master in this meeting shall prevent the Developers from being over-ambitious by selecting more Product Backlog items than they can deliver

**Sprint Retrospectives:** The Scrum Master shall conduct this retrospective meeting and shall note the areas of improvement that were suggested by the team.

**Sprint Reviews:** The Scrum Master is a part of the review meeting and captures the feedback raised by the stakeholders.

**Daily Scrum:** doesn’t need to be a part of the Daily Scrum but makes sure that the Developers conduct it on time.

### Day with Sprint Review, Retrospective, or Planning

7:45–9:00. Arrive at work. Are the sprint items done? Why not? Last-minute preps for sprint review at 9:00

9:00–10:00. Sprint review with the team. What did we finish? What’s not finished? What were our impediments? Demo sprint items. Share our velocity and other stats. Peek at what's potentially in the next sprint

10:00–10:45. Sprint retrospective: What did we do well? What can we do better? Press the team for specifics. Focus on improvement, no whiners

11:00–12:00. Go back to my desk and catch up

Noon–12:45. Grab some lunch in the café downstairs or walk somewhere nearby, or if I was organized today, eat the lunch I brought and save money.

1:00–1:30. Final prep for sprint planning with the Product Owner.

1:30–3:00. Sprint planning

3:00–5:00. Handle everything that came up from the day. Respond to emails. Clear impediments for the team. Communicate to stakeholders on how we’re progressing with some items they want to know about. Schedule meetings if needed. Look at the upcoming sprint backlog and see if we’re ready; if not, tell the Product Owner.

After 5, Head home, eat dinner, exercise, help kids with homework, play with the dog, and watch something meaningless on TV. Sleep!

## Four Main Services to the Scrum Team

1. Coaching the team members in **self-management and cross-functionality**
2. Helping the Scrum team focus on creating **high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done**
3. Causing the **removal of impediments** to the Scrum team’s progress
4. **Ensuring that all Scrum events take place** and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox

### _1. self-management and cross-functionality_

Scrum Teams as a whole need to be self-managing and cross-functional. On the level of the Scrum Team, this means that the team must have a Product Owner capable of product management, a Scrum Master capable of fulﬁlling their obligations to the team and organization, and Developers that are capable of doing the work of developing the product. To do this efﬁciently, the Developers need to be self-managing and cross-functional.

Example: Developers working on a product repeatedly fail to reach their Sprint Goal due to external dependencies. Upon inspection, **it is realized that external dependency is not unavoidable but due to a lack of a particular skill within the team.**

**solution:** The Scrum Master now needs to work with the Developers to help them understand the need for cross-functionality to reliably deliver high-value product Increments. The Scrum Master must then support the team in ﬁnding an appropriate solution, which could be that the team decides on one of its members to spend one day per week acquiring the skill that the team is lacking.

### _2. creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done_

Example: A Scrum Team has repeatedly been delivering Increments that initially satisfy the stakeholders; however, after a while, each time, technical errors are revealed. The stakeholders become dissatisﬁed with the overall state of the product. In their eyes, the value of the product has dropped due to quality concerns.

Solution: The Scrum Master help them understand quality as a key metric for value and work with them to tighten their deﬁnition of ”Done”. One key aspect of this is testing, which has been conducted insufﬁciently and  works with the team to develop a concept for automated testing, which increases the quality of the delivered Increment while limiting the amount of time spent on testing by the Developers, allowing them to deliver more features and capabilities instead and, therefore, more valuable Increments.

### 3. Removal of impediments

An impediment is anything that stands in the way of the Developers delivering value. This includes:\
&#x20;–  improper working conditions, such as a non-working air conditioning system,\
– external requests, potentially taking away capacity from the Developers,\
– technical problems, such as broken hardware, and\
– communication problems between the Developers or with the Product Owner.

&#x20;The Scrum Master’s service to the Developers is working towards the removal of these impediments. This does, however, not require the Scrum Master to remove all impediments themselves. A valid approach is to support the Developers by helping them remove their own impediments wherever possible.

Example: During the Daily Scrum, an impediment is identiﬁed: for proper software testing, the Developers require one more monitor each. One member is determined to request additional hardware from tech support. Tech support replies that the request cannot be fulﬁlled due to budgetary constraints

Solution: the Scrum Master takes ownership of the issue and reaches out to the person in charge of the budget, explains the Developers’ needs and works towards ﬁnding a solution on behalf of the team.

### 4. Ensuring Scrum Events' Effectiveness

Developers are fully involved in every scrum events

– During Sprint Planning, Developers provide their forecast, collaborate to craft a Sprint Goal and deﬁne an initial plan to reach the Sprint Goal.\
– During Daily Scrums, Developers inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal and make necessary adjustments.\
– During the Sprint Review, Developers present what they worked on, demonstrate the new Increment, and collaborate with the Product Owner and stakeholders on what the likely next steps will be.\
– During the Sprint Retrospective, the Developers participate as a member of the Scrum Team, aiming to improve the overall process.

The Scrum Master may support these events through facilitation **if they are requested to do so by a member of the Scrum Team**. Furthermore, the use of ”if needed” implies that the Scrum Master may choose to proactively take the facilitator role if they deem it necessary.

Example: The Developers provide a forecast during Sprint Planning. **They feel pressured by the Product Owner to increase that forecast for the Scrum Team to meet predeﬁned deadlines.** This pressure persists; throughout the meeting, the Product Owner pressures the Developers to take on more work than they feel is achievable.

Solution: The Scrum Master should intervene and facilitate the meeting. In the second step, the Scrum Master should work with the Product Owner on their understanding of the roles and their respective responsibilities.



the team should be able to decide who is going to work on which task, how team members can help each other when they need to learn something new, and how they prioritize their daily work in the absence of external authority.

### Characteristics of Self-Managing Teams

* **clear direction :** Members should be able to articulate the team goals, objectives, and purposes easily
* **Team oriented tasks :**Team tasks require members to work together to solve problems, complete solutions, and get the work done.
* **shared rewards :**If members are rewarded based on how the team performs, they will be more likely to encourage their members to do their work to their full potential.
* **Resources:** Self-managing teams have the resources they need to accomplish their tasks and achieve their goals
* **shared authority:** The team works together to decide on a basic work strategy and has the right to do so ****&#x20;
* **team goals :** When team goals enhance overall performance, they align with the direction and purpose of the team.
* **team norms :** When norms promote strategic thinking over work issues, such as the external environment, resources, and so on, the team can increase its overall effectiveness.

&#x20;**Scrum boundaries are determined by the process — limited by Sprint Goals, Backlog, and delivering a working product at the end.**

Every self-managed team is self-managed only within given boundaries.\


### Benefits of self-managed team

* Ability to work faster
* pivot with agility
* quality/customer focused
* less time on team management&#x20;
* A true team
* Employee satisfaction&#x20;

Scrum Masters **support team self-management** by t_eaching and coaching team practices, implementing and supporting Agile principles and practices, identifying and eliminating impediments, and facilitating flow_.

The Scrum Master

* acts as a Servant Leader, coaching the Developers to solve their problems and resolve their conflicts,
* never tells anyone what to do with regard to producing the Increment,
* teaches the team to continuously improve,
* teaches the Team to remove their impediments while supporting them, and
* helps to remove the impediments the team cannot.

## Scrum master VS Project manager

A project manager is the person in overall charge of the planning and execution of a particular project.

When it comes to agile software development the job of project manager gets divided between the 3 Roles of scrum. Because we want our team to be self-managing, there is no need for a Project Manager.

Each and every Scrum role assumes some tasks and skills of a Project Manager, but they also assume other skills, knowledge, and experience that a Project Manager does not necessarily have.

## Three Team Effectiveness Models

* the Tuckman’s Team Development Model,
* the Lencioni Model,&#x20;
* the 7T Model.

### Tuckman’s Team Development Model

Five stages of team growth were put out by Bruce Tuckman in 1965: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and Adjourning.

**Forming**\
The team is formed and everyone shows their best behavior. There is a positive and polite atmosphere. Strong guidance is needed by the facilitator as group tasks are not clearly defined yet.

As the Scrum Master, you should:

* Make it plain to your team _who is in charge_ by taking control of the situation.
* _Set clear goals and objectives_ for the entire team and each person
* Permit _open communication_ so that your team members can get to know one another.

**Storming**\
Emerging boundaries become contested and conflicts occur. Also frustration with the lack of progress is common. Guidance is needed by the facilitator.

As the Scrum Master, you should:

* Be specific and clarify goals.
* Remain positive.
* Make sure not to give the team members too much work.
* Ensure that you encourage your team members and that they support one another; at this point, trust-building is essential.
* Explain the forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning model to your team so they know what to expect.

**Norming**\
Team members start to resolve their differences, appreciate colleagues’ strengths, and respect the leader’s authority. Behavior from the storming and norming phases can overlap for some time when new tasks come up.

As the Scrum Master, you should:

* Provide feedback, both positive and negative.
* Take a step back and let your team handle the assignment; you could even start working on other tasks or even create new teams!
* Incorporate team-building exercises to strengthen unity and trust within the team.

**Performing**\
Hard work goes hand in hand with satisfaction about the team’s progress. Team confidence makes team roles more fluid and more tasks can be delegated by the facilitator. Problems are prevented or solved as they pop up.

As the Scrum Master, you should:

* Distribute tasks fairly and equally.
* Accentuate the growth of every team member.
* Allow people to join, or leave, as it won’t affect group performance.

**Adjourning**\
When all tasks are completed, it’s important to celebrate the team’s positive achievements. Letting go of the group structure after long periods of intensive team work can also generate uncertainty for individual team members.

*   As the Scrum Master, you should:

    * Allow for celebration.
    * Recognize and reward.
    * Allow for reflection: what went right? What went wrong?
    * Give guidance and support about future plans.



### The Lencioni Model

The characteristics of a cohesive team are Trust, Conflict, Commitment, Accountability, and Results. Each behavior in the model builds upon the previous and supports the others.

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team are:

* **Absence of trust**: If your team doesn't trust you, or each other, they won't do their best work
* **Fear of conflict:** Healthy, constructive conflict is a necessity to live up to their full potential.
* **Lack of commitment**: Good work takes commitment - without it can bring the rest of the team down.
* **Avoidance of accountability:** if there's no accountability, there's no success.
* **Inattention to results:** If not focused on their collective goals, they'll never hit them. One way to do this by providing a step-by-step approach for identifying and resolving issues in your organization. If you try to skip steps or ignore any parts of the process, there's a good chance that your attempts at addressing team dysfunction may fall short.

### The 7T Model

This team efficiency model focuses on internal and external factors that affect your team’s productivity and performance. Internal factors that make teams effective are:

* **Thrust** – Team members are committed to reaching set goals
* **Trust** – You’ve created an atmosphere based on trust and built strong relationships within the team.
* **Talent** – Every employee has relevant experience and skills needed for team success.
* **Team skills** – Communication and collaboration between team members run smoothly.
* **Task skills** – All team members can complete their tasks efficiently and within set deadlines&#x20;

According to this model, external factors that affect team effectiveness are:

* **Agile lead** – Employees need to trust and respect you as a leader, approving of your leadership style.
* **Team support from the company** – Providing resources from the company to help teams succeed.

Each time the product meets the Definition of Done, it has more value incrementally: this is the increment.

* how frequently the team believes they can create new increments. Put the following labels on the wall:
* Every Check-In
* Every Product Backlog Item
* Every Day
* Every Sprint
* Less Often Than Once Per Sprint

One by one, team members pick a sticky note and indicate where they think it should go. For example, a team member might pick _“All unit tests passing.”_ The team member says, _“Our continuous integration system runs unit tests for every check-in and rejects any submission with a failing test.”_ Based on this, the team agrees to put that sticky note under the heading _“Every Check-In.”_

_Problems found sooner are easier to diagnose and fix_ than problems that are found later. For example, a team that runs a full regression test at least daily will have a much easier time diagnosing and fixing the issues found, compared to a team that only runs regression tests weekly, monthly, or quarterly.

facilitating the creation and evolution of your scrum team’s definition of done:

* Invite the right participants
* Identify the work
* How often can we do it?
* Evaluating the Definition of Done
* Evolving the Definition of Done

### Agile development practices

_Agile development practices concentrate on how to support decentralized coordination in a multiple-team environment while providing enough boundaries and structure to avoid chaos._
