The Scrum Master has to explain this emerging need to the Product Owner and work with them to introduce a new technique for PBM (items are categorized by how far they have been broken down in reﬁnement, and dependencies between items are easily visible).

Scrum is predicated on the idea of a self-managing team. In order for the Scrum Team to make the best possible decisions, **all members need to understand the ideas behind what is being built, including the goals, scope and general product domain**.

* Empirical product planning for complex environment
* &#x20;_Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed_

### Collaboration

Without the Product Owner (PO) and the Scrum Master (SM), the team would lack leadership in terms of product ownership and process ownership.

They both work closely together and help ensure that feature requests, timeboxing iterations, and expectations for team members are reasonable and within the Scrum framework.

### Expectation from SM

* assist the Product Owner in the day-to-day activities.\

* obtain buy-in and coaching of the team in terms of following the Scrum framework.
* facilitate organizational change so that the organization leverages Scrum.
* support the team to remove roadblocks, both technically and organizationally.

### Expectation from PO

* The Product Owner should support a vision that will sustain a team to meet business needs.
* the Product Owner should embrace collaboration, be present to answer questions, and define not only the vision for the product as a whole but the vision and Sprint Goals for each iteration.
* a Product Owner that's going to champion the product and defend what the team delivers.

Product questions

1. What are we doing, or what will the product do?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why are we building the product?
4. What's its purpose?

Benefits of Product Goal

* Clear product definition
* Cycle predictability
* Stay on course

The Product Owner needs to be available to answer questions and communicate when requirements are unclear so the team is never blocked.

The Scrum Master is the expert on the Scrum process and framework.
