# Scrum

One of the most known framework of agile is Scrum. Scrum helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.

Since it is a framework and not a methodology, Scrum is purposefully incomplete. i.e. Having a **backlog artifact** that is suited to the project and how to  **produce a high quality work** to finish the project is left to the team so that  the team can adopt to a change.&#x20;

scrum at its core holds three empirical processes pillars.

1. Inspect : opportunity to review and examine the process
2. Adopt : Embrace the change and continue&#x20;
3. Transparency: a team needs visibility in order to make adjustments.&#x20;

Showing work early and often and being transparent on how the development is doing even if it isn't perfect, allows the team to inspect the process and adopt.

### Values of Scrum

the 5 values of Scrum are: FORCC

:eye: Focus : on the product you are trying to deliver.

:sunny: Openness : to new ideas and to ideas of others  (❌ yes but..  ✅yes and..)

:crown: Respect :  each other's ideas and opinions&#x20;

:fire: Courage : have the courage to look at things from a new perspective (learn from a failure)  &#x20;

:handshake: Commitment : that is accountable to each member of the team .&#x20;

### Who is what&#x20;

representing the users and customers of the product.

&#x20;     Responsibilities: work on the backlog and set the direction of the product.
