# Scrum

One of the most known framework of agile is Scrum. Scrum helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.

* In an essay that appeared in the Harvard Business Review in 1986, two management researchers, _Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka,_ introduced the term "scrum" for the first time to describe a framework that enables scalable business agility throughout an organization. Also, in the 1980s, _Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwabe_r started working independently with the distinctively tiny teams of Scrum. Later, in the early part of the 1990s, the two collaborated to refine the methodology and presented a paper on it at a workshop at the _Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications '95_ (OOPSLA '95) conference.

Since it is a framework and not a methodology, Scrum is purposefully incomplete. i.e. Having a **backlog artifact** that is suited to the project and how to  **produce a high quality work** to finish the project is left to the team so that  the team can adopt to a change.&#x20;

scrum at its core holds three empirical processes pillars.

1. Inspect : opportunity to review and examine the process
2. Adopt : Embrace the change and continue&#x20;
3. Transparency: a team needs visibility in order to make adjustments.&#x20;

Showing work early and often and being transparent on how the development is doing even if it isn't perfect, allows the team to inspect the process and adopt.

### Values of Scrum

the 5 values of Scrum are: FORCC

:eye: Focus : on the product you are trying to deliver.

:sunny: Openness : to new ideas and to ideas of others  (❌ yes but..  ✅yes and..)

:crown: Respect :  each other's ideas and opinions&#x20;

:fire: Courage : have the courage to look at things from a new perspective (learn from a failure)  &#x20;

:handshake: Commitment : that is accountable to each member of the team .&#x20;

### Who is what&#x20;

A scrum team needs three specific roles:

:martial\_arts\_uniform:**Scrum master** : to make sure the project is progressing smoothly and that every member of the team has the tools they need to get their job done.

&#x20;   Responsibilities : sets up meetings, monitors the work being done and facilitates release planning.&#x20;

:woman\_office\_worker: **Product owner** : helps make sure the right features make it into the product backlog

representing the users and customers of the product.

&#x20;     Responsibilities: work on the backlog and set the direction of the product.

:family: **Developers**: build the product and test it to make sure it works right.

### Scrum artifacts

are important information used by the scrum team that helps define the product and what work to be done to create the product. There are three artifacts in scrum: **product backlog**, a **sprint backlog**, and an **increment with your definition of “done”**.

### Scrum events&#x20;

Scrum combines four formal events (Planning, Daily Scrum, Review & Retrospective) for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.&#x20;

\
These events are successful because they put into practice the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
