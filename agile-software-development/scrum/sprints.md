# Sprints

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints help us to create an empirical plan that is inspectable and adoptable for product or software development.

### Scrum Events

Each Scrum event is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to provide the necessary transparency.&#x20;

Failure to carry out any events as planned results in missed opportunities to inspect and adapt. Scrum uses events to create regularity and to reduce the need for non-Scrum meetings.

1. sprint Planning: Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.     &#x20;
   * _The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal_
   *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

       **When:** At the beginning of a sprint.

       **Duration:** Usually around one hour per week of iteration. e.g. a two-week sprint kicks off with a two-hour planning meeting.
2.  Daily Scrum: The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

    *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

        **When:** Once per day, typically in the morning.

    &#x20;    **Duration:** _The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team._
3. Sprint Review: The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
   * During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
   *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

       **When:** At the end of a sprint.

       **Duration:** Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration - e.g. a 90-minute retrospective after a two-week sprint.
4. Sprint Retrospective: The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regard to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
   * The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
   *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

       **When:** At the end of a sprint.

       **Duration:** Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration-e.g. a 90-minute retrospective after a two-week sprint.

_Product Backlog Refinement_, or Grooming, and sometimes called Story Elaboration, is not an event in Scrum. However, the Scrum Guide requires the top of the backlog to be ready for work.

### Product backlog and user stories

As described in the Scrum Guide, the Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

User Stories are the interactions that a customer/user has with our product. Each user interaction with our product tells us how users are going to use our product.

User stories are a tactical tool that scrum teams use to define the work for their product. Writing a great user story can be challenging, but with practice, it gets easier over time.

Good user stories are: **INVEST**&#x20;

### Personas and outcome

A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user or customer type that might use a product in a similar way. Personas are often created through market research data and customer interviews.

An outcome is some condition or goal that a person matching the persona would like to achieve. Understanding these goals helps a Scrum Team achieve focus by clearly articulating what the user or customer would like to achieve

Using personas and outcomes has the following principal benefits:

* They help the people building the products empathize more with the users and their needs
* They help identify user pain points and create solutions
* They help create focus while still being able to see the whole

### Acceptance criteria (AC)

Each user story should have a measurement for how it is going to  accept the 'done' product. The AC is the team's most powerful tool to reduce efforts in getting the story "done."

Example&#x20;

* As a user, I can write a review on the other userâ€™s profile page to express my gratitude about their help.
  * The story is considered **done** when I can successfully display my a review about the user on their page
