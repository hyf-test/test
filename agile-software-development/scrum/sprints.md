# Sprints

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints help us to create an empirical plan that is inspectable and adoptable for product or software development.

### Scrum Events

Each Scrum event is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to provide the necessary transparency.&#x20;

Failure to carry out any events as planned results in missed opportunities to inspect and adapt. Scrum uses events to create regularity and to reduce the need for non-Scrum meetings.

1. sprint Planning: Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.     &#x20;

2. Daily Scrum: The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

3. Sprint Review: The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
   * <mark style="color:yellow;">During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.</mark>
4.  Sprint Retrospective: The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regard to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.

    * <mark style="color:purple;">The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.</mark>
