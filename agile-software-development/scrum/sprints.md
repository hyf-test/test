# Sprints

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints help us to create an empirical plan that is inspectable and adoptable for product or software development.

### Scrum Events

Each Scrum event is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to provide the necessary transparency.&#x20;

Failure to carry out any events as planned results in missed opportunities to inspect and adapt. Scrum uses events to create regularity and to reduce the need for non-Scrum meetings.

1. sprint Planning: Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.    &#x20;
   * &#x20;In this meeting, the team picks the top stories that they can work on in the existing Sprint.
     * _The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal_
       *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

           **When:** At the beginning of a sprint.

           **Duration:** Usually around one hour per week of iteration. e.g. a two-week sprint kicks off with a two-hour planning meeting.
       * Later, the team gets together to 'task out' the stories to figure out what exactly they need to do to build the software; like designing the database, developing the User Interface (UI), and so on.
2.  Daily Scrum: The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

    * For a scrum to work, it relies on the three C’s. Collaboration Communication and Cadence:
      * It occurs at the same time every day. So the Scrum Master will select a time that works for everyone.
      * During the meeting, everybody talks about what they did yesterday, what they are going to do today, and if there are any roadblocks, ask for help. No one should give a detailed breakdown of their activities. Just the overview.
      * Daily Scrums should be short. It should be limited to 15 minutes. It can be shorter, but it cannot be longer. The whole team might stand up to keep it fast.
    *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

        **When:** Once per day, typically in the morning.

    &#x20;    **Duration:** _The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team._
3. Sprint Review: The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
   * During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
   *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

       **When:** At the end of a sprint.

       **Duration:** Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration - e.g. a 90-minute retrospective after a two-week sprint.
   * Outlines to a successful meeting :&#x20;
     * Review Sprint’s results (product owner)
     * Discuss and demonstrate the work.(scrum team)
     * Update the status of the project(product owner)
     * Collaborate on the plan ahead.(The team, stakeholders, Product Owner)
4. Sprint Retrospective: The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regard to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
   * The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
   *   **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner

       **When:** At the end of a sprint.

       **Duration:** Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration-e.g. a 90-minute retrospective after a two-week sprint.

_Product Backlog Refinement_, or Grooming, and sometimes called Story Elaboration, is not an event in Scrum. However, the Scrum Guide requires the top of the backlog to be ready for work.

### Product backlog and user stories

As described in the Scrum Guide, the Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

User Stories are the interactions that a customer/user has with our product. Each user interaction with our product tells us how users are going to use our product.

User stories are a tactical tool that scrum teams use to define the work for their product. Writing a great user story can be challenging, but with practice, it gets easier over time.

Good user stories are: **INVEST**&#x20;

### Personas and outcome

A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user or customer type that might use a product in a similar way. Personas are often created through market research data and customer interviews.

An outcome is some condition or goal that a person matching the persona would like to achieve. Understanding these goals helps a Scrum Team achieve focus by clearly articulating what the user or customer would like to achieve

Using personas and outcomes has the following principal benefits:

* They help the people building the products empathize more with the users and their needs
* They help identify user pain points and create solutions
* They help create focus while still being able to see the whole

### Acceptance criteria (AC)

Each user story should have a measurement for how it is going to  accept the 'done' product. The AC is the team's most powerful tool to reduce efforts in getting the story "done."

Example&#x20;

* As a user, I can write a review on the other user’s profile page to express my gratitude about their help.
  * The story is considered **done** when I can successfully display my a review about the user on their page

## Definition of Done (DoD)

DoD describes the Development Team’s shared understanding of the work needed to create a usable, releasable increment. This definition needs to meet (or exceed) any existing organizational definition.

These definitions may include depending on how achievable and appropriate for the product and the team

* Unit tests are passed
* Code is reviewed
* Acceptance criteria are met
* Functional Tests are passed
* The Product Owner accepts the User Story

#### Sprint duration (cadence)

Scrum says that Sprint can be anywhere **from 1 to 4 weeks** in length, with a preference for a shorter timescale.

If your Sprint is too short, the team intends to panic, and the quality degrades. If your sprint is too long, the team will unconsciously relax, and their pace will degrade.

### Velocity&#x20;

**Velocity** is an indication of the average amount of Product Backlog (story points) turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Developers for use within the Scrum Team.&#x20;

### Estimate

The purpose of an estimate is to help a development team forecast what can be developed in a Sprint and to help a product owner manage a product backlog, specifically by determining whether an item has enough assumed value to warrant the investment in doing it (i.e., ROI).

You can approach estimation in two different ways:&#x20;

* Estimate the effort necessary, represented by hours or working days
* Do relative estimation, which means you compare a chunk of work to something else based on an understood reference point.

The techniques you use (planning poker) are not as important as how you use them and the benefits the Scrum Team is gaining.

### Information Radiator&#x20;

An information radiator is anything that you post on the wall or on team sites that help everyone understand what you’re doing and how it’s going.

Task board: think of it GitHub board.&#x20;

* It shows the stories committed in the sprint, the stories in their current status, and the stories that are completed.

the _x-axis is the time, showing the days of the sprint_, and _the y-axis is the total sum of task estimates_. The _blue line_ depicts _the ideal way_ the amount of work should go down. It starts with the total number of tasks, and then by the end of the sprint, it goes down to zero. The _red line_ shows the _actual task remaining_.&#x20;
