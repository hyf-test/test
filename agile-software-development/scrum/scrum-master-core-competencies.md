# Scrum Master Core Competencies

The primary accountability of the Scrum Master is to provide delivery leadership, experience, and expertise by managing the scrum process and improving their organization's ability to deliver a valuable, relevant product.

## Promoting and Supporting Scrum

They are supposed to promote Scrum. This means they are responsible for strengthening the understanding of the ideas behind the framework, as well as spreading the ideas of Scrum beyond the scope of their own Scrum Team

* coaching team members, the organization, and stakeholders

They are supposed to support Scrum. This means they are responsible for maintaining Scrum within their teams and organizations by fulﬁlling such tasks as facilitating events and removing impediments.

**Responsibility**

The responsibility of the Scrum Master is, to conduct their activities in accordance with the Scrum Guide as well as promote and support the ideas in the Scrum Guide as the ”true Scrum.”

**Helping Others Understand Scrum**

Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

* _Practices_, such as the events and artefacts of Scrum
* _Rules_, which bind the framework together and deﬁne the relationship between events, artefacts and accountabilities
* _Values_, which together with empiricism, set the foundation for Scrum by providing guiding principles for those things for which the Scrum framework does not prescribe speciﬁc methods or tools

A Scrum Master does not need to be equipped with hierarchical authority to force Scrum onto teams and organizations.

Instead, spreading and supporting Scrum can be done by helping others understand Scrum theory - namely, the empirical process control of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Many organizations, when they choose their first Scrum Masters ,they look for management or leadership experience. As they become more experienced with Scrum, organizations eventually realize there are many more factors to consider in selecting Scrum Masters.
