# Scrum

One of the most known framework of agile is Scrum. Scrum helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.

Since it is a framework and not a methodology, Scrum is purposefully incomplete. i.e. Having a **backlog artifact** that is suited to the project and how to  **produce a high quality work** to finish the project is left to the team so that  the team can adopt to a change.&#x20;

Scrum is a series of event happening in a defined period of time  called **sprints**.
