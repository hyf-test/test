# user stories

User tasks, or user stories, are a single feature or function that has been decomposed so that it can be delivered within one sprint.

The structure of the user story should indicate, that, as a user, _I want to perform this function so that I can realize this value or benefit_. Additionally, the Product Owner will provide a _Definition of Done_, so that the developer knows when all functionality has been coded. They will also include _acceptance criteria_, which may direct certain testing requirements or performance expectations.&#x20;

### Researches:

*   **Direct interviews with stakeholders**: It can provide clear language around what the user wants, from the functionality, how they intend to use it, what job they need to perform, and what result they're expecting.

    &#x20;    _The more users that want a feature, the higher up it should be in the backlog and on the roadmap_.
*   **Questionnaires:**&#x20;

    * Obtain user expertise
    * Develop acceptance criteria & definition of done
    * Promote a common consensus

### Key steps during product backlog refinement:

* First, we add more details to the user stories by doing little proof of concepts or experiments.
* Then, we estimate the effort needed to complete the work in a sprint.\

* And finally, we order items in the product backlog based on market research and interactions with customers.
